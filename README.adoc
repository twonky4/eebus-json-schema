= EEBUS Json Schemas

The XSD files included with the EEBUS protocol specification give a wrong picture of what the JSON messages look like.
To be more precise, the object types are displayed incorrectly.
It is described that elements with subelements are simple objects.
It is described as something like this:

[source,json]
----
{"connectionHello":{"phase":"pending","waiting":60000}}
----

But actually this message looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{"connectionHello":[{"phase":"pending"},{"waiting":60000}]}
----

So elements with subelements are not simple objects.
They are lists of objects where each list item contains a subelement.

For this reason, I have created a collection of JSON schema files here, which can also be used to create source code.
